About ICEPs:
	ICEPs (which stands for Ian, Chi, Elysia, and Pearl) is a group of student developers brought together initially by school requirements and constantly by emotional attachment. First established as an official team for a major academic requirement for CS 123: Software Engineering in the year 2015, ICEPs continues on to be the default team for the four members whenever the neeed arises for collaborative work. All four members are adept each with their own specialties and capabilities, and each one complements one another effectively.
	If not developing, ICEPs becomes a common group of friends with not-so-common personal interests.
